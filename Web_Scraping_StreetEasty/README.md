If you are thinking about buying an apartment in the city of New York and rent it out, this project will help you decide which neighborhood you should look into.

I scraped StreetEasy.com on 2/18/2016 using beautifulsoup package in Python, and analyzed the unit price for rent and for sale for each neighborhood in NYC.

To see the script for scraping and data manipulation, please view: scrape streeteasy and data manipulation.ipynb
